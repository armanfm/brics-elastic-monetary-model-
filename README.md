# BRICS Elastic Monetary Model  
**Designing a BRICS Basket Currency with Elastic Reconvergence**

## Overview

This repository contains a research paper proposing an elastic monetary architecture for a hypothetical BRICS basket currency.

The model combines:

- A macro-anchored fundamental value  
- A nonlinear elastic reconvergence mechanism  
- A formal local stability boundary  
- A governance concentration parameter (λ)  

The objective is to link macroeconomic anchoring, nonlinear stability, and political-economy governance into a compact and testable framework.

## Core Idea

The fundamental value of the basket is defined as:

\[
P_{fund,t} = \frac{\sum_i C_{i,t}}{Supply}
\]

where \( C_{i,t} \) represents productive capital of member \( i \).

Observed price evolves through:

1. A multiplicative speculative component  
2. A nonlinear elastic reconvergence update  

\[
P_t = (1-\alpha)P_{spec,t} + \alpha P_{spec,t} \left(\frac{P_{fund,t}}{P_{spec,t}}\right)^k
\]

---

## Stability Condition

Local stability is derived analytically:

\[
0 < \alpha k < 2
\]

This inequality provides an engineering-style calibration boundary.

---

## Governance Parameter (λ)

Basket weights may be defined using a GDP power-law rule:

\[
w_i = \frac{GDP_i^\lambda}{\sum_j GDP_j^\lambda}
\]

λ acts as a concentration knob:

- Lower λ → more neutrality  
- Higher λ → more dominance  

Concentration is measured via:

- Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI)  
- Dominant-member weight share

## Stress Testing

Monte Carlo simulations under a 2008-style systemic shock compare:

- Elastic BRICS process  
- GBM Macro benchmark  
- GBM Pure benchmark  

Results show:

- Lower drawdowns  
- Rapid re-anchoring to macro fundamentals  
- Improved stress resilience relative to unanchored stochastic dynamics

## Positioning

This work does not claim to predict geopolitical outcomes.  
It proposes a formal design framework that connects:

- Stability engineering  
- Basket governance  
- Political economy negotiation  

The framework is intentionally compact and interpretable.
